1. **Multiple Queues**

1. swap | Quanta 1  | Sum 1
2. swap | Quanta 2  | Sum 3
3. swap | Quanta 4  | Sum 7
4. swap | Quanta 8  | Sum 15
5. swap | Quanta 15 | Sum 30
5 swaps

2. **Shortest Process Next**

1.: A because shorter
2.: A because first
3.: B because shorter
4.: B because shorter

3. **CPU-bound and I/O-bound Processes**

CPU-bound processes would go faster, if the CPU were faster. 
It spends its time using the CPU. Like a virus scanner. It can run for a long time without interrupts.

I/O-bound process is a mouse click for example. They should react fast.

4. **Real Time Schedulable**

p: 50 100 200 250
c: 35 20  10  $x$

Summe: Ci / Pi <= 1

35/50 + 20/100 + 10/200 + x/250 = 1
0.95 + x/250 = 1
x/250 = 0.05
x = 0.05 * 250
x = 12.5

the largest value for x is 12.5
