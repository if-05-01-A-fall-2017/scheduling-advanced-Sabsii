1. **Multiple Queues**

First swap | Quanta 1  | Sum 1__

Second swap | Quanta 2  | Sum 3__

Third swap | Quanta 4  | Sum 7__

Fourth swap | Quanta 8  | Sum 15__

Fifth swap | Quanta 15 | Sum 30__

5 swaps

2. **Shortest Process Next**

1.: A because shorter__

2.: A because first__

3.: B because shorter__

4.: B because shorter__

3. **CPU-bound and I/O-bound Processes**

CPU-bound processes would go faster, if the CPU were faster. __
It spends its time using the CPU. Like a virus scanner. It can run for a long time without interrupts.__

I/O-bound process is a mouse click for example. They should react fast.

4. **Real Time Schedulable**

35/50 + 20/100 + 10/200 + x/250 = 1__

0.95 + x/250 = 1__

x/250 = 0.05__

x = 0.05 * 250__

x = 12.5__

the largest value for x is 12.5
